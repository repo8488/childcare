Aims of WHS Legislation

1. Protect the health, safety and wellbeing of persons at workplace.
2. Eliminate risks to health, safety and wellbeing of persons at work and the public.
3. Ensure employers and workers collaborate on issues affecting workplace health and safety.
4. Assist employers to achieve a healthy and safe workplace.

The Model Workplace Health 2011 was developed by Safe Work Australia with the aim of providing 
a nationally consistent WHS framework to secure the health and safety of workers across Australia.

The guidelines from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the Australian Commission 
on Safety and Quality in Healthcare were published in 2019
